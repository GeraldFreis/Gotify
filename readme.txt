Dependencies:
tkinter, sqlite3, beautifulsoup4, Pillow, webbrowser, time and mouse

Program made with tkinter to emulate spotify, named gotify
Program follows a minimalistic model of design and very basic widgets as this is my first real project with tkinter other than previous dabbles
Program allows users to save songs they have listened to and create playlists from these songs

Program in further developments will have AI to suggest potential songs

// Notes
1. user_list create a folder of each users name and store the liked_songs, recent_songs, made_playlists, curated_playlists inside

// things to do
1. Change the database structure for liked_songs, recent_searches (change to recent_songs)
2. Change the sorting mechanism for the databases  - specifically to get rid of the bug that double sorts a number
3. Enable the user to click on buttons and for that to open the recent_searches
4. Create a Home screen, just with widgets
5. Create the playlist feature
